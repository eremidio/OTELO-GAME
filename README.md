# OTELO  GAME
A SIMPLE BOARD GAME DONE WITH PYTHON. THIS GAME IS A VARIANT OF THE CLASSIC GO GAME THAT ONCE I HAVE FOUNFD IN THE BRAZILIAN VERSION OF THE BOOK "THE DANGEROUS BOOK FOR BOYS". I DECIDED TO MAKE A TEXT INTERFACE VERSION OF THIS GAME USING THE PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THIS REPOSITORY ALSO CONTAINS A COMPUTER X COMPUTER VERSION OF THE GAME TO SHOW HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED, COMPUTER MOVES ARE DONE USING A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR, WHICH CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE BEST APPROACH. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCLUDE  A BETTER COMPUTER MOVE GENERATION ALGORITHM, ANY CONTYRIBUTIONS IN THIS REGARD WILL BE ENIRELY WELCOME. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY DONE AS A TRAINING IN PROGRAMMING LOGIC.
